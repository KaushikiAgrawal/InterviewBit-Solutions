You are climbing a stair case and it takes A steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

/**
 * @input A : Integer
 * 
 * @Output Integer
 */
int climbStairs(int A) {
    int a[A+1],i;
    a[0]=1;
    a[1]=1;
    a[2]=2;
    for(i=3;i<=A;i++)
        a[i]=a[i-1]+a[i-2];
    return a[A];
}
